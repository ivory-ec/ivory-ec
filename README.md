- 👋 Hi, I’m @ivory-ec. Native of Anguilla, the owner of the .ai domain (something I'm oddly proud of).
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare. I firmly believe that prioritizing health is the foundation of all great things. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics of Computer Science, so all things Web Dev, Python & Java. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is fun and beneficial to society!
- 📫 How to reach me - email me at ivorycrump33@gmail.com! I'm generally very responsive. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/amazing
- ⚡ Fun fact: I eat yogurt every day. It is quite possibly the best thing to exist.
